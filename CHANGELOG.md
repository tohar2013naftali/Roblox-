# latest

:boom: it's the moment we've been working towards for a long time... V3.

## :tada: Updates

### :100: Manifest V3

It has been over half a year in the making, but we've finally done it. We're now using [Google Chrome - Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/). This means that the extension is now up-to-date with Google Chrome's latest standards. Every update I've made this year has been in preparation for this moment. I will now take my award. :trophy:

### :see_no_evil: Restored Navigation Link Overrides

okay I put the setting back to allow the navigation links to be overridden because you asked

I was too lazy to add the setting yesterday, but today I... did it, enjoyyyyy

### :arrow_double_up: Remaining Notifiers -> TypeScript

As mentioned in the previous update log, we're slowly moving the extension to be compatible with [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/). As part of that, the catalog item notifier and group notifier have been upgraded in this update. There aren't really any functional changes in how these work in this update, minor stuff you wouldn't notice anyway.

See [roblox-plus/extension#108](https://github.com/roblox-plus/extension/pull/108/files) + [roblox-plus/extension#109](https://github.com/roblox-plus/extension/pull/109/files) + [roblox-plus/extension#111](https://github.com/roblox-plus/extension/pull/111/files) if interested.

### :coffin: Dark Theme Support Loss

Dark theme is no longer supported on the [develop](https://www.roblox.com/develop?Page=ads) page. Not worth maintaining anymore, most of Roblox supports dark theme, except for this page, and I will not be supporting this signular page going forward.

### :ticket: Login Changes

I got a report from some of you that Roblox OAuth2 login wasn't working, and so you couldn't modify your settings. Sorry about that! In response I have updated how the settings page works, slightly, so as long as you are logged in on Roblox, and have the extension installed, you will be able to modify your settings. :sweat_smile:

### :framed_picture: Updated Logo

I started rolling this out a few weeks back, but now it's everywhere. Big thank you to [@younite](https://www.roblox.com/users/13042729/profile) for the updated icon for the extension. It's a perfect refresher for this large project. :pray:

## :relieved: Break Time

I've been working on this extension almost every weekend since October 2022, and I am ready to take a break. I realize I went on an extended break from March 2021 -> October 2022, but... it is time for me to disappear again. Hopefully not for as long as last time, but I have a full time job outside of this extension. So giving my weekends to this extension is a little rough.

I plan to come back later in 2023 with more updates which brought me to make this extension in the first place. ðŸ«¡

In the meantime, please enjoy the features provided by this extension to their fullest extent, and have a great day. :grin:

# 2.4.210

Good morning :sweat_smile:

See what I did there? That's an emoji.. and whoa.. where are we? Welcome to [roblox.plus](https://roblox.plus/about/changes)! This is the new domain where some parts of the extension will exist going forward. At the end of last year, Roblox launched their beta OAuth2 project, and I was invited to join it. Since October 2022 I have been working every weekend to make the extension compatible with both [Roblox OAuth2](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/open-cloud/oauth2-overview), and [Google Chrome - Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/). It has been... a motivational struggle, as I'm sure you've seen in the update logs, if you've been paying attention. But here we are I guess. We're getting close enough to finishing up more than half a years worth of work, enough so that I'm finally ready to start sending you all to this page.

Going forward, this page is where you will get information about what has updated in the extension. This page will also be based on the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/roblox-plus/extension/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), where you can then find information about previous versions and stuffs.. assuming I populate it. I have all the data about previous versions somewhere, I promise.

Also also, there's a little selector in the top right, in case you didn't notice it - and you can view the update logs for the other versions.

## :tada: Updates

### :new: roblox.plus/about

god, I can use emojis now, this feels soooo good
yes, this is just to say that we actually have an about page now, with a bunch of information. Look on the left navigation there, click around, and read the stuffs.

okay fine, I put in absolute minimal effort into each of those tabs _except for_ the [privacy policy](https://roblox.plus/about/privacy-policy)

but whatever man

### :gear: roblox.plus/settings

For as long as this extension has been around, there have been settings. This page has seen many iterations over the years, and it's onto the next. For a long time the settings page has existed in the [Roblox account settings page](https://www.roblox.com/my/account) as its own tab. But no longer - welcome to [roblox.plus/settings](https://roblox.plus/settings).

The settings for this extension now live under this domain. And in the future, as a result, we may be able to have settings that can be enabled for Roblox without having the extension installed. But for now that is only a dream. For now it's the same settings we had before, just with more emojis, in a new home.

### :arrows_counterclockwise: Trade Notifier Updated

This thing has been updated to better support that manifest V3 thing I was talking about. Pretty much works the same as it did before, except you can't pick a sound for it anymore. Sorry.

### :axe: Removed chrome.webRequest

This update removed the remaining usages of one of the older chrome APIs that was being used by this extension: [chrome.webRequest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webRequest). The remaining usages were replaced with [chrome.declarativeNetRequest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest), which is compatible with manifest V3.

### :knife: Removed Navigation Overrides

I have decided to remove the feature that let you override the right two navigation links. Mainly because I didn't feel like adding them to the new settings page, and I don't use this feature myself. If I am in the wrong.. voice your concerns on [GitHub](https://github.com/roblox-plus/extension/issues), make an argument for why it should stay.

### :mute: Notification Sounds Removed

What you may have also noticed... is that you can no longer pick a custom sound to play when you get a notification. This is in preparation for maybe notifications working without having the extension installed, and then being in line with what browsers support by default, without extensions. Sorry.
